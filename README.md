This repo includes the libraries used for the sparse DNN computation in [Scalpel](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jiecaoyu/papers/jiecaoyu-isca17.pdf).

Computation is optimized with the SSE instructions. Test on Intel Core i7-6700 CPU.

Initialized with all the code. But need to add documents. Still under construction.
